# Assessment 2 Practice – Python

This repository contains **practice problems for Assessment 2**, focusing on core Python fundamentals.

The goal is to help students prepare by practicing **problem-solving**, **logic**, and **syntax** — not by memorising solutions.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Functions
- Basic loops (`for`, `while`)
- Advanced loops (nested loops, `break`, `continue`)
- Simple algorithms (prime checking, factorials, counting problems)
- Pattern problems
- Basic command-line concepts

---

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

1. **Fork** this repository (do not clone it directly)
2. Clone **your fork** to your local machine
3. Open the project in **VS Code**
4. Work inside `practice.py`
5. Implement **one function at a time**
6. Test your solution before moving on

⚠️ All functions contain `pass` on purpose.  
You are expected to write your own solutions.

---

## ❌ Important Rules

- Do **not** push solutions back to the original repository
- Do **not** copy solutions from others
- Use this for **practice**, not shortcuts

---

## ✅ Study Tip

If you get stuck:
- Re-read the docstring carefully
- Break the problem into small steps
- Use print statements to understand your loop logic
- Ask for help *after* trying

---

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this practice, you should be comfortable with:
- Writing clean functions
- Using loops correctly
- Applying conditions logically
- Solving problems step by step

Good luck with Assessment 2 🚀
